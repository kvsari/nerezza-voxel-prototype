# Nerezza Voxel Engine

Playing around with making a voxel engine for an RPG called Nerezza. Sadly the project died. But I did get some simple voxel stuff happening :)

# Build

Make sure you have SDLv1 dev libs installed.

Then just run
```
$ make all
```

Two binaries will be created. Run `voxel` to have a look at super simple voxel rendering.
